# Movie Recommendation System v1.0

Hello, Welcome to our Movie Recommendation system made using the Java Springboot framework. In this recommender, we used the algorithm found in Java Programming: Build a Recommendation System (https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming-recommender/home/welcome). 

The system works by first asking the user for a set of ratings for 10 random movies then the system would recommend some movies for the user based on the ratings the user gave.
